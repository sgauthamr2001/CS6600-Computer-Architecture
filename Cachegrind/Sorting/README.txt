- Each sub-folder contains the experiments relavant to the name of the folder. 
- To run any C code use cc name.c, and the test vector size is to be passed on cmd line as ./a.out N
- run_fast.sh (fast algorithms) runs the code for base case configuration for sizes 250K, 500K, 750K, 1000K, output is stored as {folder_name}_i.
- For running the cache-grind for bubble and selection sort for 250K, bash script is provided inside the sub-folders. 
- To run other perf and time tests bash scripts have been provided in the sub-repositories.
- To run the experiments for different cache configurations, config.sh script is provided in each repository, output is stored as {config}_i. 
- In radix, radix_20.c corresponds to the code for radix sort with parameter 20. 
- {folder_name_cache} includes the terminal output when cachegrind was run on the executables. 
- {folder_name_perf} includes the terminal output when perf was run on the executables. 
- {cache_config} includes the terminal output when cache design parameters were varied. 
- In case of any issues while running please mail to, ‘ee19b053@smail.iitm.ac.in’.
